Odin signal library<br>
<br>
Mostly for Linux (non-Windows) systems.<br>
Provides a wrapper of Odin's libc signal bindings.<br>
This is here for future projects.<br>
Signal definitions could be more granular per OS. I may make updates to those over-time.<br>
<br>
Could setup your own signal definitions and just you the procedure calls with those if the pre-defined ones are accurate for your OS.<br>
