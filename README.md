Odin signal library

Mostly for Linux (non-Windows systems.
Provides a wrapper of Odin's libc signal bindings.
This is here for future projects.
Signal definitions could be more granularly defined per OS.

Could setup your own signal definitions and just you the procedure calls with those if the pre-defined ones are accurate for your OS.
